=== Detailed Description
  This handler searches for incidents in Serice Now and returns any that meet
  your query in JSON format. The return json uses the sys_id as the key and the
  value is another JSON map with all the information about the incident. To
  query for an incident, you need to provide the query in xml. The handler uses
  the getRecords call from the Service Now SOAP API, so the parameter provided
  just needs to specify what to look for in incident fields. For example, if you
  are searching for a date (or anything that can't be qualified by a direct
  equality statement), you can use the <__encoded_query> parameter, which can be
  used for any general query statements. For example, you could search for any
  incidents that were created after a certain time
  (ie. <__encoded_query>sys_created_on > 2014-04-15</__encoded_query>). For
  everything else, you can make the search with the xml tag beings the field
  that you want to search. For example, if you want to match a incident number
  or short description, you would search for <number>INC000000001</number> or
  <short_description>this is a short description</short_description>.
