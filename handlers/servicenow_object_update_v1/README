  JSON Body:                      {"short_description": "Changed the description"}

=== Detailed Description
  This handler allows you to generically update an existing object in a
  ServiceNow table by passing an id and the fields/values that should be updated
  on the object in a JSON body. Using the ServiceNow REST API and basic
  authentication, a URL and a PUT body are created using the inputted parameters
  which is then sent to ServiceNow. If the REST call is successful and the
  included id exists, the handler will complete and return an empty result set.
