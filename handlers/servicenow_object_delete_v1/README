=== Detailed Description
This handler allows the generic deletion of a ServiceNow object when given a
table and an id. Using the ServiceNow REST API and basic authentication, a URL
is built up to delete an object from a table by its sys_id. If that REST call is
successful, the handler execution will complete and an empty result set will be
returned.
