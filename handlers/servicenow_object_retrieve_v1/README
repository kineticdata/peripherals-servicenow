=== Detailed Description
This handler allows the generic retrieval of a ServiceNow object when given a
table and an id. Using the ServiceNow REST API and basic authentication, a URL
is built up to retrieve a record from a table by its sys_id. If that REST call
successfully finds the record attached to that Id, a JSON representation of the
object will be returned as handler results.
